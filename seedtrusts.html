Our name SEEDS TRUST stands for 

Schooling – Education – Empowerment – Developments

The SEEDS Trust is a registered South African NPO (NPO 075-523) and Public Benefit Organization (PBO Ref. no. 930023539), founded in 1999 by Marlena & Johann van der Walt. They were members of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship Hout Bay and started by encouraging church members to begin caring for toddlers of underemployed parents while they were at work or seeking work. In the meanwhile Charl van de Walt has taken over the chair from his late father.



Education brings hope for the future. Gives self-worth and dignitity. 

All people should have a right to these. Through its various projects, SEEDS TRUST strives to make this possible for as many people as possible, in an atmosphere of love and Godly values.</b>
